Notes:
1. If Mario jumps and meet a ladder you will climb up.
2. If Mario fall after jumping and meet a ladder he will stay on the ladder (until another button will be pressed).
3. Pressing 9 while playing will exit the active game and send you to the menu (only in save mode or with no mode).
4. There are ladders without floor at the top.
5. The barrels start rolling from 2 sides randomly.
6. Mario hit with hammer is 2 chars away and not 1 - Link to the forum where said it's ok: https://mama.mta.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=3638
7. Mario can't use the hammer when he is on ladder and also not while jumping or falling
8. If a board isn't valid the game will try to load the next board.
9. If a ghost's position isn't on a floor, it will fall until it gets to floor.
10. If there are more than one Mario/hammer/donkeykong/Pauline, the game will continue with the first readen one.
11. If there are no Mario/Pauline/donkeyKong, the board is invalid.
12. Mario gets score when he kill a ghost/ destroy a barrel or moving to the next the stage.
13. Mario loses points when dying.
14. If there is no floor (all or part of it) and Mario stands on there he will die ("The floor is lava").
15. Please run with compilier C++20.
16. Please set the compiler to "build only" and not "build+intellisense" (Amir told us to do that, otherwise it shows uncorrect errors).
17. If you are in "save mode" you start from the first screen only.
18. In the results file:  0=died, 1=finished, 2=finished dead, 3=no result
19. If you run the game without any flags your game won't be saved.
20. In "save mode": All previously existing results and steps files are deleted.

Asks for bonuses:
1. ASCII art.
2. Score management: All the parts of the score- gain score, lose score and showing the player his score at the end of every
 stage make it a lot more fun to play.
3. The special ghosts chase after Mario based on his place.
